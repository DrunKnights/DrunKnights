# drunKnights
App project for Knight Hacks 2017 Hackaton.

App done in Android Studio by Shane Ferrell, Liana Severo, and Cody Jordan, with the help of our amazing Mentor Charlton Trezevant! With very, very little sleep, and lots of caffeine.

Special thanks to Levi and his beautiful face, for inspiration for this app.

Carlos gets an honorable mention for making ONE commit (adding the entirety of the Bees movie script as a text file). Thank you for your contribution, Carlos.
